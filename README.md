# Library-Book-Management-System-
The Library Book Management System is designed to manage books, library members, and  book borrowing activities in a school or public library.  Many libraries still face challenges such as poor record keeping, missing books, and difficulty  tracking borrowed items due to manual systems.
## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **MySQL** – Database management system  
- **SQL (Structured Query Language)** – Used for querying and managing data  
- **MySQL Workbench** – Database design and administration tool  
- **GitHub** – Version control and project hosting  
- **ER Diagram Tool (Draw.io / Lucidchart)** – Used for designing database diagrams
- ## 📌 Problem Statement

Libraries need an organized way to manage books and track which members have borrowed them.  

Without a proper database system, libraries experience:

- Loss of books  
- Difficulty tracking borrowed and returned books  
- Duplicate book and member records  
- Slow access to information  

This project aims to solve these problems by building a structured and normalized database system.

## 📋 Project Questions / Tasks

### 1️⃣ Database Model
- Explain why the relational database model is suitable for a library management system.  
- Discuss how tables, primary keys, and foreign keys help maintain data integrity.  

---

### 2️⃣ Entities, Relationships, and Attributes
- Identify the main entities in the library system.  
- Define their attributes and relationships.  
- Draw an ER diagram showing all relationships clearly.  

---

### 3️⃣ Normalization
Initially, all library data (books, members, borrow details) is stored in a single table.

#### Tasks:
- Explain the problems with this design  
- Explain why normalization is necessary  
- Normalize the database up to **Third Normal Form (3NF)**
